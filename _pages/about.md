Welcome to my personal blog! Here, I share insights into my journey as a Data Engineer and my passion for the world of data. You'll discover my struggles, how I overcome them, and the lessons I learn on a weekly basis.

### My Background
I am a Data Engineer with a deep understanding of the Data Product Life Cycle, backed by extensive experience in handling terabytes of data. My career is driven by a profound passion for working in various domains, including:
- **Search Engineering**
- **Internet Measurements and Traffic Analysis**
- **Internet Infrastructure Monitoring**
- **Internet Security**
- **Health Care**

My dedication to these industries fuels my desire to contribute my skills in creating impactful solutions with a global reach. Beyond this, I hold a strong belief in the power of Open-Source Data Technologies as pioneers of innovation and collaboration in the data field. I thrive on taking on new and challenging projects, pushing boundaries, and making a difference.

### Past Accomplishments
In my previous role as an Open-Source Data Engineer Intern at Internet Health Report, supported by Ripe NCC—one of the five regional internet registries covering Europe, the Middle East, and parts of Central Asia—I had the privilege of participating in the Google Summer of Code Program. During this time, I accomplished the following:

- Empowered network administrators, policymakers, and stakeholders with advanced network monitoring, situational awareness, and data-driven decision-making capabilities.
- Seamlessly integrated alarm data from IHR, GRIP, and IODA, leading to comprehensive visualizations of BGP hijacking, routing, delays, and outages for worldwide internet infrastructure oversight.
- Detected and documented real-world internet outages in Brazil that happened on August 15, 2023, at 11:30 UTC, effectively showcasing the tangible impact of the project's insights.
- Introduced dynamic World Map, Time Series, and TreeMap visualizations, providing adaptable insights across different levels of granularity.
- Collaborated closely with stakeholders to gather feedback, drive iterative improvements, and lay the foundation for future expansions.
- Explored possibilities for integrating new data sources to enrich system capabilities and enhance overall accuracy.
- Designed and implemented a robust Alarms Correlation and Aggregated Reports system using the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture, enhancing modularity and separation of concerns.
- Leveraged the Joi data validation library for JavaScript to ensure impeccable data quality and validation, bolstering the accuracy of integrated external data sources.
- Utilized Jest, with a primary focus on integration test cases, to rigorously validate system components, ensuring reliability and seamless interaction between different modules.
- Orchestrated Continuous Integration through GitHub actions, automating testing and deployment processes, thereby expediting development cycles and enhancing efficiency.
